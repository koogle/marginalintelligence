The name for this blog actually came to me half-remembered in a dream. It references two things:

- The excellent [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/) blog
- The insights that are found in the notes scribbled in the margin of books

I read that online blogging is a single-player online game, and I want to give it a try.
 
Posts will be published as sketches and change over time.
