Growing up I was always told to save water and energy as "the earth's resources are finite and we only have one earth". This always struck me as wrong but at the same time it is such a simple and obvious statement that it is hard to refute.

I think it is a very common statement in Germany and has influenced the culture a lot in back half of the 20th century. The idea is basically that at one point we are going to use the last liter of fresh water

- degrowth
- infinite

- at the same time obvious false
- the last couple of centuries

- if you think about a roman they would say there is only so much wood 
- new inventions allows us to use new resources

- there is no acutal loss apart from the loss in energy
- every day the fusion reactor in the sun gives us boundless free energy as does the gravity pull from other celestial bodies

the real idea behind this is 
- this is as good as it gets 
- no technological progress
- lets just manage things rather than accelerate and change things
