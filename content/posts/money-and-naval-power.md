When reading about the Napoleonic Wars one thing that jumps out is the fact that Britian was Napoleons main antagonist throughout the successive wars but direct engagements between French and British Troops are much rarer than for example the confrontations with Austria.

Since Britian is much closer to France one would expect frequent clashes either in the channel or via expeditionary forces. Napoleon dreamed about invading Britian and dealing with "the nation of shopkeepers" once and for all(**). The obvious answer is that miles of cost are much easier to defend than conquer (Omaha beach comes to mind) and after the Royal Navy sunk the main parts of the French fleet at Travalgar an invasion of the British Isles was next to impossible. Any invasion would have had to rely on favourable weather and hope to not be detected by superior Navy ships.

After the French fleet was dealt with Britian blockaded French ports in and around the Medditerian and seized French vessels(**). Brittania ruled the seas and had a world spanning empire. The budding industrial revolution meant that British productivity and industry outpaced the rest of the continent(**).

So why then did Britian not invade France (earlier) and put an end to French wars on the contient?

Britian was a Naval power akin to the United States today. Her wealth and dominance came from the combination of a world-spanning trade system (**) that allowed for the global flow of goods from and to Britian (denoted in GBP **) and an industrial base that was technologically superior.

First and foremost this meant Britian had a lot of money to put it cruedly.
If Britian wanted to fight France it had multiple options:

It could raise a large contiental army and fight on the continent itself but at great risk. It would have been a huge logistical undertaking to supply an army across the water in enemy terriory. More over the clashes between contiental forces in the Napoleonic Wars were the hugest losses of human life seen up to this point in warfare(**).

Britian had some experience with continental armies in the form of the troops used by the East India Company during their conquest of India, but the key difference to was that in India the EIC was using local troops led by British leader rather than troops comprised out of a majority of British soldiers (**).

But Britian had a much more attractive option on the table:
Use its dominance of commerece and sea to prop up and France's enemies on the continent and have them fight the French armies or threaten the France homeland. In various instances it outright paid Russia, Prussia and Austria (\**) to fight France. It used deplomatic and economic ties to bolster the enemies of France. It supplied weapons and supplies to various allies all over the continent and supported insurections against French rule (\**, reference lent & lease).
All of this meant that Britian had no desire to raise a large army herself but rather have her allies assume the human cost of the fight against Napoleon and the destruction to their terrorities. The fact that the British Isles were never under direct attack meant that they could keep expanding their trade networks and grow their economy and keep supporting its allies.

Napoleon saw some of it and tried to weaken the British economy through a continental tarrif regisment but never fully succeeded. one could argue that an massive economic downturn might have ended Britians policy and lead to a collapse of its ability to support the various Coalition but the higher productiity and her colonies means she had ample reasouces.

Britian spend a huge amount of money on supporting her allies, but it was a cheap bargain compared to the cost of fighting herself (##).
