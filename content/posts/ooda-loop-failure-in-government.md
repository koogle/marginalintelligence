The OODA Loop is a key concept in militrary and strategic decision making. The idea is that at every given moment, a decision maker is running a loop of Observe-Orient-Decide-Act, in essence observe your surroundings, adjust your mental model accordingly, decide on the best course of action and execute it. In a military setting getting inside the enemies OODA loop is is a key advantage. If you can run your own loop much faster than an adversary you end up in a situation where you can act before your enemey has even reacted.
An extreme example of this in history is that the Mongol armies riding on horseback, would often travel as fast as the fastest means of communciation at the time: The time you realised the Mongol Army was marching on your city was when they appeared in front of your gates. Even in less extreme cases it meant that armies would encounter them unprepared or out of position.

## Public Policy and the OODA loop

The OODA loop is not restircited to military context. It is also encountered in civil settings such as when companies or governments have to make decisions. In my view, the state of German politics is a good example of what happens when reality gets inside the OODA loop of the governemnt. Germany politics are consensus driven and big policy decisions are often deliberated for a long time. Often a group of experts is send on a fact finding mission before making any decsions. Their findings are then input into the political decision making process.
