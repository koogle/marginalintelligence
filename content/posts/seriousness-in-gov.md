The most suprising things that have happened in the last 5 years are where geopolticial actors did the thing they said they would do.
Putin has said again and again that ukraine is a part of russia and will be incorperated
Isreal has said that for Iran to getting the nuke is unacceptable

The problem is that western politics have become unserious and we project that to our partners
It is the end of democracy or the end of society if party x and y comes into power. but then they come into power and things do not change (as much as we expected).
We are seeing talking heads talk about how climate change will destory our way of life in a single digit number of years but life seems to go on.

The trust has fallen sharply into news media because we preceive that what our leaders say and what they do are far apart.
We have internalised that poltics is more a game or a fake fight like wrestling to the point where we project it onto other countries.

The problem is that especially countries who believe themselves to be in a struggle for the core of their nation are actually serious.
They believe in the words they say and use force to back it up.
This means that it injects a level of seriousness into our polticis that we are fundamentally not used to.

We have been crying wolf for years to the point where we do not believe someone else would cry wolf and be serious about it.
and then the wolf shows up.

This poses the question, are we able to get back to being serious about our own politics.
I am sceptical as we have build systems that incentivise  fake conflict and empty promises.
The illusion of action rather than real change, as real change is hard and can lead to a lot more resistance.

A more relastic approach would be that our politcans and leaders are aware of the unserious of domestic polticis while taking foreign actors very seriously.

Meaning can we avoid and be prepared if more actors follow through on their promises.
If China reintegrates Taiwan by force who will be suprised?by force
